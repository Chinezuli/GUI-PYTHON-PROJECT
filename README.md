Hello ! This file contains the project for the subject from the faculty called Applied Informatics, I had to make a GUI in python, only the basic stuff, without QT6, just the basic stuff, pysimplegui, customtkinter, and others. This project should mean a phone application to be a kind of survival guide, with several attributions. I know it's not a successful one, but we didn't have time to realize it, because we were given a week, I know it seems enough to you, but if you have other subjects in which you have projects, it's hard to work on everything.
